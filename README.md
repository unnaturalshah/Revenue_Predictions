# Background
The proposed project resides in the film or motion picture industry domain as I enjoy the creativity used to inspire mass audiences globally to feel distinct emotions. The Movie Database (TMDb) and Kaggle teamed up to create a competition with metadata on over 7,000 past films to try and predict the movie’s expected overall worldwide box office revenue based on data before the release of the movie in the box office.

This competition was released a month ago and meets the various needs of the Capstone project including the benchmark models published in the leaderboard on Kaggle. The data is very engaging for me as it has a slew of numeric, text, and relational data that requires cleansing and transformation. In addition, no target/dependent variable was provided therefore I will use some supervised, unsupervised, deep learning, and reinforcement learning techniques to deploy and put to test. 

##Problem
The problem to be solved is predicting a movie's worldwide box office revenue pre-release. In the spirit of the competition, the actual revenue figures are not provided however one could easily connect to TMDb’s API to download actual revenue data for all movies in the train and test sample provided. This regression problem is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable given that for each movie in the test set we need to predict the value of the revenue variable.
